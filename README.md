# Credit Card Spending by Generation â€“ Tableau Dashboard

This project explores how different generations spend on their credit cards. I used Tableau to build an interactive dashboard that highlights spending habits, transaction volume, and card preferences based on age groups.

What the Dashboard Shows:
- Which generation spends the most on average
- How transaction count changes with age
- What card types are used most frequently
- The ability to filter everything by generation

Tools Used:
- Tableau Public (for visualizations)
- Excel (basic data cleanup)
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers

If you're curious about generational trends in credit usage or just want to explore how simple data can tell a story, this is a quick but insightful project to check out.
